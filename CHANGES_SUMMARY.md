# Security & Cleanup - Changes Summary

## Date: 2025-10-07

## Overview
Fixed security issues and cleaned up the Nous study tracker application by removing hardcoded Firebase credentials and implementing proper configuration management.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Exposed Firebase Credentials
**Problem**: Firebase API keys and configuration were hardcoded in multiple files:
- `index.html` (lines 104-112)
- `firebase.js` (entire file)
- `test.html` (lines 15-23)

**Solution**:
- Created `config.js` for local credentials (gitignored)
- Created `config.template.js` as a template for developers
- Updated `index.html` to load config from external file
- Added `config.js` to `.gitignore`

### 2. ✅ Unused Files
**Problem**: Repository contained unused files that also exposed credentials:
- `firebase.js` - Duplicate Firebase config, never imported
- `test.html` - Test file with hardcoded credentials
- `hi` - Random Java source file (35KB, unrelated to project)

**Solution**: Deleted all three files

### 3. ✅ No Build Process for Production
**Problem**: No secure way to inject credentials during deployment

**Solution**:
- Created `generate-config.sh` - Build script to generate config from environment variables
- Updated `netlify.toml` to run the build script
- Documented environment variable setup for Netlify

### 4. ✅ Missing Documentation
**Problem**: No clear setup or security instructions

**Solution**: Created comprehensive documentation:
- `README.md` - Full project documentation
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policies and best practices
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions

## Files Added

```
config.template.js       # Template for Firebase configuration
config.js               # Actual credentials (gitignored)
generate-config.sh      # Build script for production
SECURITY.md            # Security documentation
DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md    # Deployment instructions
CHANGES_SUMMARY.md     # This file
```

## Files Modified

```
index.html             # Updated to load external config
.gitignore            # Added config.js
netlify.toml          # Updated build command
README.md             # Complete rewrite with instructions
```

## Files Deleted

```
firebase.js           # Duplicate config
test.html            # Test file with credentials
hi                   # Unrelated Java file
```

## Git Status

Before committing, verify:
```bash
git status --ignored | grep config.js  # Should show config.js is ignored
git log --oneline -5                   # Review recent commits
```

## Security Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Credentials in version control
- ❌ Credentials exposed in multiple files
- ❌ No production credential management
- ❌ Test files with credentials

### After
- ✅ Credentials gitignored
- ✅ Single source of truth for config
- ✅ Environment variable support for production
- ✅ All test files removed
- ✅ Comprehensive security documentation

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Security: Remove hardcoded credentials and implement proper config management"
git push
```

### 2. Revoke Exposed Credentials (IMPORTANT!)
Since credentials were previously committed to git:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Create a new project or regenerate credentials
3. Update local `config.js` with new credentials
4. Update Netlify environment variables

### 3. Set Up Firebase Security
- Apply Firestore Security Rules (see SECURITY.md)
- Enable Authentication methods
- Restrict API key usage

### 4. Deploy to Netlify
- Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
- Deploy and test
- Configure custom domain (optional)

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
- [x] Config.js loads correctly
- [x] Server starts without errors
- [x] Config.js is gitignored
- [ ] App functions correctly (requires manual testing in browser)
- [ ] Timer works
- [ ] Can create habits
- [ ] Can save sessions

### Production Testing (After Deployment)
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Config.js generated from env vars
- [ ] App loads on Netlify URL
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Database operations work
- [ ] No console errors

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor Firebase usage
- Review security rules
- Keep Firebase SDK updated
- Rotate credentials if compromised
- Review Netlify deployment logs

### When Adding New Developers
1. Share `config.template.js`
2. Provide Firebase credentials securely (not via email/chat)
3. Have them create local `config.js`
4. Verify their setup works
