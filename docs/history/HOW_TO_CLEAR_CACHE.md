## Why Do You Need to Clear Cache?

PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) cache files aggressively for offline use. This means:
- Old icons stay cached even after we deploy new ones
- Your phone doesn't automatically check for updates
- You need to manually clear the cache to see changes

## When to Clear Cache

Clear your cache when:
- Icons look off-center or wrong
- You're seeing old versions of the app
- Features aren't working as expected
- After any major app update
