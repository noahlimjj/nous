# Calendar-Based Checklist Feature for Nous App

## Overview
This document outlines a Google Keep-style daily checklist combined with calendar-based schedule view as a prototype feature for the Nous ecosystem. This feature aims to enhance natural-language interaction, task organization, and cross-day linking capabilities.

## Core Objectives

### Checklist Functionality
- Allow users to create and view daily checklists in natural language
- Each checklist item can be:
  - ✅ Completed
  - ⏳ Pending
  - 📅 Assigned to a date/time
  - 🏷️ Categorized (e.g., "gym", "study", "meeting", "travel")
- Support quick inline edits (add, remove, check/uncheck)
- Accept shorthand input like "gym 10am" or "meet Shermaine at KKH 3pm"

### Calendar Integration (Prototype)
- Every checklist can be anchored to a date (e.g., "22/10 Wed")
- When dates are specified, create a "calendar view" that organizes lists chronologically
- Support future view toggles:
  - 🗓️ Daily view — list items for a single day
  - 📅 Weekly view — show all tasks per day
  - 🧭 Timeline — summary of upcoming events (e.g., "Fly off Nov 2 → Compete Nov 4 → Fly back Nov 5")

### Contextual Awareness
- Recognize patterns like:
  - "train 10 am" → category: training
  - "sch till 5 pm" → category: academic
  - "fly off nov 2" → category: travel
- Maintain awareness of continuity (e.g., week progression, overlapping tasks)
- Suggest structured summaries per day (e.g., "Focus: Study + Performance")

## Technical Implementation

### Class Structure
The feature is implemented in the `CalendarChecklistManager` class with the following key methods:

- `parseInput(input)` - Parse user input and extract tasks with dates/times
- `addTask(task)` - Add a task to the checklist
- `toggleTask(taskId)` - Toggle task completion status
- `deleteTask(taskId)` - Delete a task
- `renderChecklistView(date)` - Render checklist view for a date
- `renderWeeklyView(startDate)` - Render weekly view
- `processCommand(command)` - Process user commands

### Data Structure
- Tasks are stored in a Map with date as key and array of tasks as value
- Each task object includes:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `time`: Time in HH:MM format
  - `task`: Task description
  - `category`: Task category (training, academic, personal, travel)
  - `done`: Completion status (boolean)
  - `icon`: Visual indicator based on category

## Interaction Examples

### User Input Example:
```
21/10 Tues
train 10 am
meet Shermaine at 3 pm KKH
gym

22/10 Wed
no gi am
oc at night
```

### System Output:
```
🗓️ Tuesday, Oct 21, 2025
[ ] 10:00 – BJJ Training 🥋
[ ] 15:00 – Meet Shermaine @ KKH 💭
[ ] 18:00 – Gym 🏋️‍♂️
Focus: Training + Social

🗓️ Wednesday, Oct 22, 2025
[ ] 07:00 – No-Gi Session 🥋
[ ] 20:00 – OC Study Night 🧠
Focus: Training + Academic
```

### Command Support
The system supports various commands:
- `add [task] on [date/time]` - Add a new task
- `check [task name]` - Mark task as completed
- `show calendar view` - Show weekly view
- `delete [task/date]` - Delete a task
- `summarize week` - Show week summary
- `clear completed` - Remove completed tasks

## Integration Possibilities for Nous App

### Future Connections
- Google Calendar API → auto-sync tasks with your actual calendar
- Meal Schedule App → display nutrition blocks between workouts
- Nous Analytics → generate performance trend summaries (study vs. recovery balance)
- Focus Mode (AI) → highlight top 3 daily priorities

### Database Integration
The feature can be integrated with Firestore to provide persistence:
- Store checklists in a new `checklists` subcollection
- Link with existing `sessions` and `habits` for comprehensive tracking
- Implement real-time synchronization similar to existing Nous features

## Design Philosophy
This prototype is not just a to-do app — it's a thought-organizing framework built around:
- Temporal structure (dates/times)
- Context (academic, athletic, personal)
- Progressive intelligence (learning your rhythms over time)

Its purpose is to eventually evolve into the central Nous Scheduling Engine, capable of connecting mind, schedule, and performance metrics.

## Next Steps
1. Test the JavaScript implementation with various user inputs
2. Create UI components for the Nous app to display the calendar checklist
3. Integrate with Firebase Firestore for persistence
4. Connect with existing Nous features (habits, sessions, etc.)
5. Develop AI-powered scheduling suggestions
