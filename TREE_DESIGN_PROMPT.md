## Detailed Tree Design Prompt

Create an SVG illustration of a simple, cartoon-style tree with the following specific proportions and characteristics:

### Overall Proportions
- **Total Height**: The tree should be approximately 400-500px tall
- **Width**: Approximately 350-450px wide
- **Canopy-to-Trunk Ratio**: The foliage/canopy should take up roughly 60% of the total height, with the trunk taking up the remaining 40%

### Canopy/Foliage Design
1. **Shape**: Create a cloud-like, organic rounded shape for the tree canopy
2. **Style**: The canopy should be composed of multiple rounded, overlapping bubble-like sections that merge together
3. **Size**: The canopy width should be approximately 80-90% of the total tree width
4. **Outline**: Add a dark stroke (approximately 3-4px thick, color: #2d3436 or similar dark gray/black) around the entire canopy perimeter
5. **Fill Color**: Use a soft, natural green color (suggestions: #a8d08d, #b5d99c, or #c3e2a3)
6. **Texture/Depth**: Add subtle shading or gradient within the canopy to give it depth:
   - Lighter green towards the top/center (#d4e8c1)
   - Slightly darker green towards the bottom/edges (#98c379)
7. **Bumps/Lobes**: The canopy should have approximately 7-9 rounded "bumps" or lobes around its perimeter to create the cloud-like appearance

### Trunk Design
1. **Proportions**:
   - Width at base: approximately 25-30% of canopy width
   - Height: approximately 35-45% of total tree height
   - Tapers slightly from bottom to top
2. **Shape**:
   - Slightly wider at the base (flared roots)
   - Narrows as it goes upward
   - Top portion splits into 2-3 branches that connect to the canopy
3. **Color**: Warm brown/tan color (suggestions: #c9a67a, #d4a574, or #c4a57b)
4. **Outline**: Same dark stroke as the canopy (3-4px thick, #2d3436)
5. **Shading**: Add subtle shading to the trunk:
   - Lighter on one side to indicate light source
   - Slightly darker on the opposite side
6. **Base**: The trunk should have a gentle flare at the bottom, creating a stable, rooted appearance with small rounded feet/roots

### Branch Connection
1. **Visible Branches**: 2-3 short branch sections should be visible where the trunk meets the canopy
2. **Branch Angle**: Branches should angle upward at approximately 30-45 degrees
3. **Integration**: The branches should appear to support and connect naturally to the canopy
4. **Gaps**: Small white/transparent gaps between the branches and canopy edge to show depth

### Style Guidelines
- **Art Style**: Simple, clean, cartoon/illustration style
- **Line Weight**: Consistent stroke thickness throughout (3-4px)
- **Stroke Color**: Dark charcoal or black (#2d3436 or #000000)
- **Fill Colors**: Solid or subtle gradients only - no complex patterns
- **Corners**: All shapes should have smooth, rounded corners (no sharp angles)
- **Background**: Transparent background (no background fill)

### Technical Specifications (for SVG)
```
Viewbox: "0 0 500 500"
Canvas center: 250, 250
Canopy center approximately: 250, 180
Trunk base approximately: 250, 450
```

### Color Palette
- **Canopy Main**: #a8d08d (soft lime green)
- **Canopy Light**: #d4e8c1 (pale green for highlights)
- **Canopy Dark**: #98c379 (deeper green for shadows)
- **Trunk Main**: #c9a67a (tan/beige)
- **Trunk Light**: #ddc194 (lighter tan for highlights)
- **Trunk Dark**: #b08d5f (darker brown for shadows)
- **Outline**: #2d3436 (dark charcoal)

### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity**: Keep the design clean and uncluttered
2. **Organic Shapes**: All shapes should feel natural and hand-drawn, not geometric
3. **Balance**: The tree should feel visually balanced and stable
4. **Cartoon Appeal**: Friendly, approachable, not photorealistic
5. **Scalability**: Design should work at any size (SVG vector format)

### Key Features to Capture
- ✅ Cloud-like, fluffy canopy with multiple rounded lobes
- ✅ Solid, sturdy trunk that tapers upward
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy (canopy is the focal point)
- ✅ Warm, inviting color scheme
- ✅ Clean, bold outline that makes the tree pop
- ✅ Subtle depth and dimension through shading
- ✅ Organic, natural feel despite simplified style

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Overly geometric or symmetrical shapes
- ❌ Sharp angles or corners
- ❌ Too many small details
- ❌ Harsh or saturated colors
- ❌ Complex patterns or textures
- ❌ Thin or inconsistent line weights
- ❌ Realistic leaf or bark textures

### Example Structure Description
"The tree has a large, puffy canopy that resembles a soft green cloud with gentle bumps and curves around its perimeter. The canopy sits atop a sturdy, tapered brown trunk that widens at the base with small root-like feet. Two or three branches emerge from the top of the trunk, reaching up to support the canopy. The entire illustration uses a clean, cartoon style with consistent dark outlines and soft, warm colors. The tree feels friendly, stable, and inviting - like something from a children's book illustration."

## Alternative Prompt (Concise Version)

Create a simple, cartoon-style tree illustration in SVG format with these characteristics:

- **Canopy**: Large, cloud-like shape made of 7-9 rounded bumps, soft green color (#a8d08d), taking up 60% of tree height
- **Trunk**: Tan/beige (#c9a67a), tapers from bottom to top, approximately 40% of tree height, wider at base
- **Proportions**: Canopy is roughly 350px wide, trunk is about 100px wide at base
- **Outline**: Consistent 3-4px dark stroke (#2d3436) around all shapes
- **Branches**: 2-3 visible branches connecting trunk to canopy at 30-45° angles
- **Shading**: Subtle gradients for depth (lighter at top, darker at bottom)
- **Style**: Clean, friendly cartoon aesthetic with smooth curves and organic shapes
- **Background**: Transparent

The tree should feel balanced, approachable, and suitable for a study tracking app - conveying growth and progress in a positive, encouraging way.

## Usage Notes

This prompt can be used with:
- AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- AI code generators (Claude, GPT-4) for SVG generation
- Human illustrators for design specifications
- Design tools that accept text-based design descriptions

Adjust proportions and colors as needed while maintaining the overall aesthetic and feel of the original design.
