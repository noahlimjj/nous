# Delete Session Feature

## Overview
Added functionality to delete individual study sessions from both the Dashboard and Reports pages. This allows users to remove accidentally recorded sessions (e.g., sessions left running too long).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Delete Session Function

#### Dashboard Component (index.html:1143-1154)
```javascript
const handleDeleteSession = async (sessionId) => {
    if (window.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this session? This cannot be undone.")) {
        try {
            const sessionDocRef = window.doc(db, `/artifacts/${appId}/users/${userId}/sessions/${sessionId}`);
            await window.deleteDoc(sessionDocRef);
            setNotification({ type: 'success', message: 'Session deleted successfully.' });
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error deleting session:", error);
            setNotification({ type: 'error', message: 'Failed to delete session.' });
        }
    }
};
```

#### Reports Component (index.html:1536-1566)
```javascript
const handleDeleteSession = async (sessionId) => {
    if (window.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this session? This cannot be undone.")) {
        try {
            const sessionDocRef = window.doc(db, `/artifacts/${appId}/users/${userId}/sessions/${sessionId}`);
            await window.deleteDoc(sessionDocRef);
            setNotification({ type: 'success', message: 'Session deleted successfully.' });
            // Refresh data after deletion
            // ... (refreshes sessions and reportData)
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error deleting session:", error);
            setNotification({ type: 'error', message: 'Failed to delete session.' });
        }
    }
};
```

### 2. UI Changes

#### Dashboard - Recent Sessions (index.html:1463-1482)
- Added delete button (trash icon) to each session
- Layout changed to flex with session info on left and delete button on right
- Delete button has hover effects (red text/background on hover)

```javascript
React.createElement('div', { key: session.id, className: "border-b pb-2 last:border-b-0 flex items-center justify-between gap-2" },
    React.createElement('div', { className: "flex-grow" },
        // Session info...
    ),
    React.createElement('button', {
        onClick: () => handleDeleteSession(session.id),
        className: "p-2 text-gray-400 hover:text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50 rounded transition flex-shrink-0",
        title: "Delete session"
    },
        React.createElement(TrashIcon)
    )
)
```

#### Reports - Session Log (index.html:1615-1634)
- Same layout and styling as Dashboard
- Delete button with identical behavior and appearance

## Features

### Confirmation Dialog
- Shows "Are you sure you want to delete this session? This cannot be undone."
- User must confirm before deletion
- Can cancel to keep the session

### Success Notification
- Displays "Session deleted successfully." on successful deletion
- Notification auto-dismisses after a few seconds

### Error Handling
- Shows "Failed to delete session." if deletion fails
- Logs error to console for debugging

### Real-time Updates
- Dashboard: Sessions automatically update via Firestore's onSnapshot listener
- Reports: Manual refresh of data after deletion to update both session list and chart

## User Flow

### From Dashboard (Recent Sessions)
1. User sees a trash icon next to each session in "recent sessions"
2. Click the trash icon
3. Confirm deletion in dialog
4. Session is deleted from Firestore
5. UI automatically updates (session disappears)
6. Success notification appears

### From Reports (Session Log)
1. Navigate to Reports page
2. See trash icon next to each session in "session log"
3. Click the trash icon
4. Confirm deletion in dialog
5. Session is deleted from Firestore
6. Session log and chart update immediately
7. Success notification appears

## Testing

### Automated Test
Created `test-delete-session.js` which verifies:
- ✓ Delete button is visible on sessions
- ✓ Confirmation dialog appears
- ✓ Session is deleted from Firestore
- ✓ UI updates correctly
- ✓ Success notification displays
- ✓ Session count decreases

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the app: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. Open http://localhost:8080
3. Continue as Guest
4. Create a habit
5. Start and stop timer to create a session
6. Verify delete button appears in "recent sessions"
7. Click delete button
8. Confirm deletion
9. Verify session disappears and notification shows
10. Navigate to Reports page
11. Verify delete button appears in "session log"
12. Create another session and delete it from Reports
13. Verify deletion works the same way

## Database Impact
- Deletes single document from `/artifacts/${appId}/users/${userId}/sessions/{sessionId}`
- No other collections affected
- Action is irreversible (no undo functionality)

## UI/UX Considerations
- Trash icon is gray by default, turns red on hover for clear visual feedback
- Icon is small and unobtrusive to not clutter the interface
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Success/error notifications provide clear feedback
- Button has descriptive title attribute for accessibility

## Files Modified
- `index.html`:
  - Added `handleDeleteSession` function to Dashboard component (line 1143)
  - Updated Dashboard recent sessions UI to include delete button (line 1463)
  - Added `handleDeleteSession` function to Reports component (line 1536)
  - Updated Reports session log UI to include delete button (line 1615)

## Future Enhancements
- Add bulk delete (delete multiple sessions at once)
- Add "undo" functionality with a brief window after deletion
- Add session edit functionality (edit duration or date)
- Add delete session from habit detail view
- Add confirmation option to "Don't ask again" (with localStorage)
