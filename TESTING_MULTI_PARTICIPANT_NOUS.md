### ‚úÖ Test Case 6: Chat During Multi-Participant Session

8. All three should see both messages
9. Unread badge should appear for those who haven't opened chat

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS if all participants see all messages

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 7: Session Flow Option B (Independent Timers)

**Goal:** Verify each person's timer starts from 0 when they join

**Steps:**

1. **Alice sends request to Bob and Carol**
2. **Bob accepts immediately** ‚Üí his timer starts at 00:00:00
3. **Wait 1 minute**
4. **Carol accepts** ‚Üí her timer starts at 00:00:00 (not 01:00:00)
5. **Alice's timer shows** 01:00:00+ (started when she sent)
6. **Bob's timer shows** 01:00:00+ (started when he accepted)
7. **Carol's timer shows** 00:00:00+ (just started)

**Important:** Currently the implementation starts timer when ALL accept. This is option A, not option B.

**To implement option B properly, we would need:**
- Each participant has their own start time
- UI shows each person's individual time
- When stopped, each person gets their own elapsed time

**Current behavior:** All participants get same time (start time = when all accepted)

**Expected Result:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently FAILS - implements option A (shared start time)
- Need to modify if option B (individual start times) is required
